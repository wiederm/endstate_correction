Welcome to endstate_correction's documentation!
=========================================================

Following an arbritary thermodynamic cycle to calculate a free energy 
for a given molecular system at a certain level of theory, we can perform 
endstate corrections at the nodes of the thermodynamic cycle to a desired 
target level of theory.
In this work we have performed the endstate corrections using equilibrium 
free energy calculations, non-equilibrium (NEQ) work protocols and 
free energy perturbation (FEP).
